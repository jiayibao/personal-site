I am a PhD Candidate in [Business Economics and Public Policy](https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu) at [the Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu). I study human capital and workplace problems in entrepreneurial settings, using a combination of theoretical modeling, econometric analysis, and experimental design. My job market paper specifically examines how heterogeneous workers respond to the perk of _unlimited vacation_ - a popular perk in technology startups - and how firms can strategically benefit from the use of such a perk.

I have won a number of awards for my research, including multiple grants from the [Mack Institute of Innovation Management](https://mackinstitute.wharton.upenn.edu/) and the [Kauffman Knowledge Challenge](https://www.kauffman.org/currents/2018/11/announcing-the-32-inaugural-knowledge-challenge-grantees?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=iaw_11_08_2018) grant for the study of entrepreneurship. I am also a coauthor of the [_American Angel Report_](https://www.theamericanangel.org/), a comprehensive national study on angel investors who are crucial to the founding of high-growth startups. 
<br><br>

I graduated from [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/) in 2014 with a joint degree in Economics and Mathematics (with General Honors and Departmental Honors) and received the DeGolier Prize for the student with the highest academic average. Prior to Wharton, I worked in multiple organizations including PIMCO, Merrill Lynch, and Mizuho.
