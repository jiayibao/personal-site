I am a PhD Candidate in [Business Economics and Public Policy](https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu) at [the Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu). My research focuses on human capital strategy and workplace diversity issues in different contexts of entrepreneurial forms and phases, drawing from the rich interplay of phenomenon and theory at the intersection of strategy, human resource management, and entrepreneurship. Linking macro patterns to micro behavior, my work exploits a variety of methods including theoretical modeling, qualitative data analysis, econometric analysis of archival data, and experimental design. My job market paper specifically examines how heterogeneous workers respond to the perk of _unlimited vacation_ - a popular perk in technology startups - and how firms can strategically benefit from the use of such a perk.

I have won a number of awards for my research, including multiple grants from the [Mack Institute of Innovation Management](https://mackinstitute.wharton.upenn.edu/) and the [Kauffman Knowledge Challenge](https://www.kauffman.org/currents/2018/11/announcing-the-32-inaugural-knowledge-challenge-grantees?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=iaw_11_08_2018) grant for the study of entrepreneurship. I am also a coauthor of the [_American Angel Report_](https://www.theamericanangel.org/), a comprehensive national study on angel investors who are crucial to the founding of high-growth startups.

I graduated from [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/) in 2014 with a joint degree in Economics and Mathematics (with General Honors and Departmental Honors) and received the DeGolier Prize for the student with the highest academic average. Prior to Wharton, I worked in multiple organizations including PIMCO, Merrill Lynch, and Mizuho.
