    degree: 'Do Makerspaces Affect Entrepreneurship ? Evidence on Entry, Experimentation, and Commercialization.',
    abstract: 'Makerspaces are physical spaces that provide individuals with fabrication tools and materials, such as 3D printers and laser cutters, for the making of artifacts. This study examines whether makerspaces affect entrepreneurship, and if so, how. I argue that makerspaces provide the technology infrastructure that reduces the costs and time of prototyping and consequently affect three entrepreneurial stages: (1) the affordable access to physical prototyping resources encourages more entrepreneurial entry, (2) the rapid prototyping procedures accelerate the experimentation process, and (3) the concrete prototypes that boost pitch effectiveness increase the likelihood of commercialization success. Using both hand-collected data on 462 U.S. makerspaces and archival data on 235,409 Kickstarter projects, I find consistent evidence supporting these arguments through an instrumental variable design, leveraging the weather of the first, field-configuring local Maker Faire as an instrument that exogenously affects subsequent local makerspace establishments. Post-hoc analyses and extensions to two alternative settings (self-employment and venture capital deals) suggest that more technology-based entrepreneurial activities are more likely to benefit from these effects.'

    degree: 'Healthcare Social Safety Nets, Gender, and Innovative Entrepreneurship.',
    abstract: 'This paper examines whether improved healthcare social safety nets reduce the gender gap in innovative entrepreneurship. I argue that improved healthcare social safety nets provide substitutes to employer-provided health insurance, thus removing job mobility constraints by lowering the opportunity cost of leaving employment. I propose that women are affected more than men and that innovative women are particularly more likely to enter entrepreneurship than noninnovative women because of a stronger preference for health-related benefits and a greater propensity to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities. Leveraging the quasi-experiment of the Affordable Care Act implementation, I find consistent evidence supporting these arguments and a reduced gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) entrepreneurship. The findings shed light on how institutional policies promote diversity in innovative entrepreneurship.'

    degree: 'Does Unlimited Vacation Benefit Firms? An Examination of How and When.',
    abstract: 'This paper provides a comprehensive study of unlimited vacation, an employee benefit that entails schedule flexibility and autonomy, through three complementary settings. Qualitative data (Setting 1) on benefits reviews are explored to motivate theoretical development. Evidence from a randomized controlled trial (Setting 2) suggests that, despite more vacation use, the unlimited vacation scheme improves overall labor efficiency through two channels that increase labor productivity: (i) attracting more high-performers and (ii) improving individual productivity. A field study (Setting 3) confirms the productivity effect and increased vacation use. Together, four organizational conditions in performance systems and social relationships are found to support larger labor efficiency gains under unlimited vacation: a stronger firing threat for under- performance, bundled features that emphasize performance, better managerial support, and greater team cohesion.'

    degree: 'Organizational-Performance Pay and Compensation Dispersion.',
    abstract: 'We document the performance implications of compensation dispersion under organizational-performance pay, a scheme where individual compensation consists of a pre-designated share of rewards contingent on organizational performance. We examine the field setting of professional eSports athletes facing an exogenous change in the distribution of shares of team-based rewards. We find that unequal, heterogeneous share dispersion—relative to equal, homogeneous compression—results in lower organizational performance. While share dispersion aligns the incentives of high-share individuals with the organization’s—motivating them to contribute more—it also engenders unfavorable social comparison among low-share individuals—demoralizing them into contributing much less. A complementary controlled experiment validates the findings and demonstrates that organizational-performance pay, relative to other payment schemes, exacerbates the consequences of dispersion especially when reward-sharing is cognitively salient.'
