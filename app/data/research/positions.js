    degree: 'Do Makerspaces Affect Entrepreneurship ? Evidence on Entry, Experimentation, and Commercialization.',
    abstract: 'Makerspaces are physical spaces that provide individuals with fabrication tools and materials, such as 3D printers and laser cutters, for the making of artifacts. This study examines whether makerspaces affect entrepreneurship, and if so, how. I argue that makerspaces provide the technology infrastructure that reduces the costs and time of prototyping and consequently affect three entrepreneurial stages: (1) the affordable access to physical prototyping resources encourages more entrepreneurial entry, (2) the rapid prototyping procedures accelerate the experimentation process, and (3) the concrete prototypes that boost pitch effectiveness increase the likelihood of commercialization success. Using both hand-collected data on 462 U.S. makerspaces and archival data on 235,409 Kickstarter projects, I find consistent evidence supporting these arguments through an instrumental variable design, leveraging the weather of the first, field-configuring local Maker Faire as an instrument that exogenously affects subsequent local makerspace establishments. Post-hoc analyses and extensions to two alternative settings (self-employment and venture capital deals) suggest that more technology-based entrepreneurial activities are more likely to benefit from these effects.'

    degree: 'Healthcare Social Safety Nets, Gender, and Innovative Entrepreneurship.',
    abstract: 'This paper examines whether improved healthcare social safety nets reduce the gender gap in innovative entrepreneurship. I argue that improved healthcare social safety nets provide substitutes to employer-provided health insurance, thus removing job mobility constraints by lowering the opportunity cost of leaving employment. I propose that women are affected more than men and that innovative women are particularly more likely to enter entrepreneurship than noninnovative women because of a stronger preference for health-related benefits and a greater propensity to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities. Leveraging the quasi-experiment of the Affordable Care Act implementation, I find consistent evidence supporting these arguments and a reduced gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) entrepreneurship. The findings shed light on how institutional policies promote diversity in innovative entrepreneurship.'

    degree: 'Self-Presentation and Racial Hiring Inequality.',
    abstract: 'This paper provides novel empirical evidence on how professional appearance differentially affects the hiring outcomes of Black and White candidates. We develop a machine learning algorithm to measure the professional appearance of 86598 profile photos of 65186 candidates in an online contractor labor market. Analyzing employer hiring decisions, we find that candidates are more likely to be hired when they are perceived as more professional, but the effect of an enhanced professional image is significantly weaker for Black candidates than for White candidates. Our preregistered, controlled experiment, which manipulated within-individual professional appearance, further supports these findings. Additional analyses suggest that external pressure to increase diversity can improve the benefit of professional appearance for Black candidates relative to White candidates. The study offers novel insights into the role of professional norms in hiring decisions and highlights the need to address systemic bias against Black candidates in the hiring process. This study contributes to the literature on discrimination, diversity, and organizational behavior and has policy implications for creating a more equitable and inclusive workplace.'
