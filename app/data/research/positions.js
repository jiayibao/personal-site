    degree: 'Social Safety Net and New Venture Performance: The Case of New Jersey Paid Family Leave Program.',
    abstract: 'This study examines how social safety nets for employees influence subsequent business performance for entrepreneurial ventures. A difference-in-differences design exploiting the 2009 New Jersey Paid Family Leave program shows that the program adversely affects the profitability of the average new venture. Innovative ventures, however, experience increased profitability. Timing of the treatment effects indicates that distinct employee preference and behavior channels drive the opposite effects. Qualitative interviews confirm the suggested mechanisms and motivate new hypotheses on boundary conditions that affect (1) competition for talent, (2) employee motivation, and (3) capability of absorbing productivity shocks. The negative effect of the program is then found to be mitigated or reversed when ventures: (1) face more recruitment disadvantages, (2) have more incentive-aligned employees, or (3) hold more slack resources.'

    degree: '(How) Do Risky Perks Benefit Firms? The Case of Unlimited Vacation.',
    abstract: 'This paper provides a comprehensive study of unlimited vacation, an employee benefit that entails schedule flexibility and autonomy, through three complementary settings. Qualitative data (Setting 1) on benefits reviews are explored to motivate theoretical development. Evidence from a randomized controlled trial (Setting 2) suggests that, despite more vacation use, the unlimited vacation scheme improves overall labor efficiency through two channels that increase labor productivity: (i) attracting more high-performers and (ii) improving individual productivity. A field study (Setting 3) confirms the productivity effect and increased vacation use. Together, four organizational conditions in performance systems and social relationships are found to support larger labor efficiency gains under unlimited vacation: a stronger firing threat for under- performance, bundled features that emphasize performance, better managerial support, and greater team cohesion.'

    degree: 'Organizational-Performance Pay and Compensation Dispersion.',
    abstract: 'We document the performance implications of compensation dispersion under organizational- performance pay, a scheme where individual compensation consists of a pre-designated share of rewards contingent on organizational performance. We examine the field setting of professional eSports athletes facing an exogenous change in the distribution of shares of team-based rewards. We find that unequal, heterogeneous share dispersion—relative to equal, homogeneous compression—results in lower organizational performance. While share dispersion aligns the incentives of high-share individuals with the organization’s—motivating them to contribute more—it also engenders unfavorable social comparison among low-share individuals— demoralizing them into contributing much less. A complementary controlled experiment validates the findings and demonstrates that organizational-performance pay, relative to other payment schemes, exacerbates the consequences of dispersion especially when reward-sharing is cognitively salient.'

    degree: 'Approaching or Avoiding: Gender Asymmetry in Reactions to Prior Job Search Experience.',
    abstract: 'Despite recent increases in female entry into male-typed jobs, women tend to be more likely to exit these jobs than men, leading to a “leaky-pipeline” phenomenon and contributing to continued horizontal gender segregation. Extant work on employer discrimination and gender differences in application choice offers only partial explanations because this research does not address observed differences between women and men in persistence in these job domains. The authors propose that employers’ hiring decisions—specifically, their rejection of job applications—play a vital role in shaping job applicants’ persistence in male-typed job domains. Rejections are more likely to dampen women’s job-seeking persistence than men’s. Regression analyses of more than 700,000 applications for more than 200,000 job postings by more than 70,000 freelancers in an online contract labor market demonstrate that women are more likely than men to reduce job-seeking activity following rejections in the male-typed domain of IT and programming. Reduced job-seeking in turn leads to eventual exit, resulting in a lower proportion of female freelancers in this male-typed job domain over time. By contrast, analyses of female-typed writing and translation jobs do not reveal similar gender patterns. Implications for research on gender segregation, careers, and hiring are discussed.'
