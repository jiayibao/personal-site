    degree: 'The Paradox of Resource Provision in Entrepreneurial Teams: Between Self-Interest and the Collective Enterprise',
    abstract: 'Using a nationally representative multi-wave panel study of nascent entrepreneur, we investigate the antecedents and consequences of the founding entrepreneur’s paradox: assembling an entrepreneurial team as a way of eliciting contributions from others may not provide enough resources to launch new venture. We argue that the precarious nature of the early founding stage and the intrinsic properties of valuable resources, such as difficulty in withdrawing or redeploying them for other uses, may amplify the risk of early-stage resource contributions and increase team members’ tendencies toward free-riding and hold-up. The expectation that early entrepreneur efforts will not pay off may discourage individuals from investing their own resources early on, generating tension between individuals’ natural dispositions to guard their personal interests and a team’s dependence on collective efforts, ultimately limiting members’ contributions. Analyzing a representative sample of entrepreneurial teams in the United States assembled in 2005, we show that early-stage team members are more willing to provide extractible/duplicable resources (i.e. information, advice) than non-extractible/non-duplicable resources (i.e. financial resource and time). Pre-signed formal contracts and founding entrepreneurs’ initial contributions make members’ contributions more likely. Our results suggest that entrepreneurs’ commitments to their business, signified by their contributions of valuable resources, help mitigate the tension between individuals’ tendencies to preserve their personal resources and a teams’ reliance on collective effort for success in cases where teams have not signed collective agreements regarding ownership.'

    degree: 'Approaching or Avoiding: Gender Asymmetry in Reactions to Prior Job Search Experience',
    abstract: 'This paper presents a novel investigation into how supply-side job seeking interacts with demand-side hiring decisions to reproduce occupational gender segregation. The authors theorize that because female job seekers are less confident of their ability in male-typed jobs than their male counterparts, they will be more responsive to cues from employers. Specifically, job application success will encourage female job seekers to approach similar work in the future; employers’ rejections, on the other hand, will be particularly discouraging, leading women to avoid similar work in the future. Analyses of a longitudinal dataset of three million applications for IT and programming jobs from an online freelancing platform support the theory. Past job-seeking experience, either positive or negative, exerted a stronger effect on how women, compared to men, approached or avoided applying to IT and programming. Because failure is the more prevalent outcome, female freelancers stop applying to male-typed jobs quicker than males. In contrast, analyses in the female-typed writing and translation field did not reveal similar gender patterns. Gender asymmetries in response to employers’ hiring decisions reproduce occupational gender segregation by reducing women’s representation in male-typed but not female-typed fields. Implications for research on gender segregation, careers and hiring are discussed.'

    degree: 'Against All Odds: Why Black Entrepreneurs Are More Motivated and Persistent and Spite of Lower Business Success',
    abstract: 'Grounded in AMO (ability, motivation, opportunity) theory, this study takes a first step toward bringing race back into the entrepreneurship literature to predict how the race of the founding entrepreneur (i.e., Black or White) influences motivation to start a business and subsequent persistence and performance. We describe how, due to historic and present-day societal discrimination, Blacks tend to have fewer opportunities in the highest-ranking positions of Corporate America, and they are underrepresented in the upper echelons relative to their proportion of the workforce. Such barriers to Blacks in wage employment motivate them to enter and persist in entrepreneurship despite their lower odds of success. Using a sample from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics II (PSED II), we find that Black potential entrepreneurs have fewer relevant skills to start a business (e.g., less managerial experience) compared to White potential entrepreneurs, yet they have stronger motivation to start a business to make new opportunities for themselves and their families. We also find that Black individuals are more likely to start businesses than White individuals, and that although Black entrepreneurs are less financially successful than White entrepreneurs, they are more persistent than White entrepreneurs. The positive association between Black entrepreneurs’ race and business persistence is partially mediated by higher levels of motivation to run one’s own business.'

    degree: 'Equality and Equity in Compensation',
    abstract: 'Do workers have different equality preferences depending on the type of payoff? In firms offering equity compensation (i.e., stock options), the distribution of equity compensation often differs more substantively than the distribution of cash salary. We design an experimental group production game to examine how workers respond to combinations of different distributions of equity and salary. Results suggest that workers view salary and equity in two separate domains, and they are more inequality averse in the equity domain. Furthermore, we find a presentation effect underlying inequality aversion in different payoffs: the separation of the two domains is only triggered when equity is shown in a different percentage form from the absolute form of salary.'

    degree: 'When Time-Off Sparks Time-At-Work',
    abstract: 'This paper studies how the adoption of paid vacation as a human resource practice impacts organizations in the context of new ventures. I find that the provision of paid vacation to employees positively affects both short-term venture revenue and long-term survival. I then investigate why. I do not find empirical support that paid vacation helps ventures to attract better talent. The results are most consistent with an incentive story that paid vacation brings about organizational gains by incentivizing workers to take actual time off which ultimately improves their productivity at work.'

    degree: 'Why Firms Offer Dicey Perks? The Case of Unlimited Vacation',
    abstract: 'The use of employee perks is becoming increasingly important to organizational competitiveness as firms are experiencing recruiting difficulty. Typically, firms introduce perks to attract workers to stay at the workplace. However, another set of perks that makes it easier for people to leave the workplace has gained more popularity over time. These perks, exemplified by unlimited vacation, attract talent, but can also be “dicey,” presenting costs and risks to firms when abused by workers. Motivated by a content analysis of qualitative benefits reviews about unlimited vacation, I establish a theoretical model to predict how heterogeneous workers respond to the perk and when firms should adopt it. I test the predictions via a randomized controlled experiment with an online labor market by recruiting workers to a one-month job. I find that unlimited vacation can offer strategic benefits to firms in three major ways: (1) attracting the more capable candidates to the recruitment pool, (2) creating complementarity to work that makes people more productive, and (3) inducing extra work outputs from happier workers. Furthermore, a strong firing threat undermines the attractiveness of unlimited vacation, but reduces the likelihood of slacking and nudges workers to produce more. Finally, workers under unlimited vacation on average take more vacation time than their counterparts under capped vacation.'
